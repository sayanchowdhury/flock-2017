title: What is Fedora Hubs?
subtitle: Defining the Fedora Hubs project
build_lists: true

- It’s an ‘intranet’ page for the Fedora Project. You work on all these different projects in Fedora, and it’s a single place you can get information on all of them as a contributor.
- It’s a social network for Fedora contributors. One place to go to keep up with everything across the project in ways that aren’t currently possible. We have a lot of places where teams do things differently, and it’s a way to provide a consistent contributor experience across projects/teams.
